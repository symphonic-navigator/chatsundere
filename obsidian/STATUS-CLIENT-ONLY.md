# Chatsundere Status — Client-only

**Last updated:** 2026-05-23 evening — Phase 2 (Settings + Circle +
Persona Editor + Entrance Hall) implementation complete. Eighteen plan
tasks squashed into one Phase-2 commit; 353 tests pass across all
workspaces (129 user-client + 82 llm-unified + 142 crypto); typecheck
clean; user-client `pnpm build` clean; Biome lint clean. Manual smoke
deferred to Chris's device-test. Block-1 wireframes landed in
`chatsundere-prototype.html` for Reading + Interaction Mode +
Entrance Hall + My Settings + My Circle + Persona Editor; only My
History (Phase 4) remains wireframe-blocked. Phase 3 (Chat surface —
Reading + Interaction + Streaming) is the next deliverable; Phase 4
(History + Polish) follows once Lyra's history wireframe lands.
Brainstorm spec at
[`superpowers/specs/2026-05-23-client-block-1-design.md`](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-23-client-block-1-design.md);
Phase-2 plan at [`superpowers/plans/2026-05-23-client-block-1-phase-2-settings-circle.md`](../superpowers/plans/2026-05-23-client-block-1-phase-2-settings-circle.md).

This file tracks **client-only / standalone-mode work** — everything
the user-client can do without talking to a server. The goal is that
Chatsundere is an excellent experience even in pure-local mode; sync,
homelab, and sidecar live on the server side and are tracked in
[[STATUS-BACKEND]]. Read both files at the start of every session;
update the relevant one at the end.

## Scope

### In scope here

- Local chat experience (UI, message rendering, session shape)
- LLM provider integration as far as the client owns it (model
  selection, prompt routing, per-provider auth)
- Local storage of chat sessions / conversation context
- User-facing UX patterns (pill handling, expressive feedback,
  organic variation, omakase defaults)
- Data model for future tool support (stored only, no execution)
- Neurodivergent-accessibility behaviour and review surfaces

### Deliberately out of scope (deferred)

- Tools execution (data model lives here; no execution surface)
- Knowledge bases / libraries
- Integrations (homelab, sidecar)
- Voice (Block 4 — Chris's expressive-voice concept lands later)
- Cloud sync ([[STATUS-BACKEND]] territory)

---

## Done

- **Status-tracking split (2026-05-23)** — STATUS.md → STATUS-BACKEND.md;
  STATUS-CLIENT-ONLY.md established for the standalone-mode side; cross-
  refs set; CLAUDE.md §6/§16 still reference the old single STATUS.md
  and need an update on a later doc-touch commit.
- **UX-CONCEPT.md landed (2026-05-23)** — full operating-concept brief
  by Chris + Lyra; serves as the North-Star concept document for the
  client-only work. Open Questions section flags Mindspace palette,
  textures, voice-pill treatment, et al.
- **First interactive wireframe (2026-05-23)** —
  `chatsundere-prototype.html`. Covers Reading Mode + Interaction Mode
  + Entrance Hall + Treasury. Visual ground truth for Phase 3.
- **Block 1 design spec (2026-05-23)** —
  `superpowers/specs/2026-05-23-client-block-1-design.md`. 16 captured
  decisions, 4-phase implementation plan, 15 acceptance criteria.
  Chris-approved.
- **Phase 1 implementation plan (2026-05-23)** —
  `superpowers/plans/2026-05-23-client-block-1-phase-1-backbone.md`.
  13 tasks, fully TDD-structured. Subagent-driven execution.
- **Phase 1 — Backbone, complete (2026-05-23)**. Squashed into one
  commit. What landed:
  - `apps/user-client/src/lib/secrets.ts` — DEK-backed AES-GCM seal/open
    with `slotId` AAD binding (defends against ciphertext-swap across
    storage slots). 10 Vitest tests.
  - `apps/user-client/src/boot/client-data-db.ts` — Dexie DB
    `chatsundere_client_data` with seven tables (settings, providers,
    personas, mindspaces, chats, messages, pills), UUIDv7 IDs per
    ADR 0025, idempotent v1-seeding of three built-in mindspaces
    (Aurum, Azuro, Verdan) + settings singleton. Boot opens both
    crypto DB and client-data DB in parallel. 5 Vitest tests.
  - `apps/user-client/src/routes/onboarding/matrix.tsx` — three
    server-coupled cells disabled with `aria-disabled` + "Coming with
    Block 2" tooltip per UX-CONCEPT "Disabled over Hidden"; only
    "Just this device" remains an active link. 3 Vitest tests.
  - `packages/llm-unified/` — full library: 7 modules + 3 built-in
    providers + 7 test files. Registry pattern ported from
    `../chatsune/backend/modules/providers/_registry.py`.
    Single OpenAI-chat-completions adapter shape; three pre-registered
    providers (nano-gpt, Novita AI, Ollama Cloud) with CORS hints
    (`inofficial` / `direct` / `requires-proxy`). Transport routes
    direct or via cors-proxy. Hand-written SSE parser with split-chunk,
    abort-signal, and tool-call support. System-prompt composition is
    a pure module with stub Project + Memory slots. Probe surfaces
    structured ProbeResult for "Test Connection". 41 Bun tests.
  - Test runner split per CLAUDE.md: Bun for `packages/llm-unified`,
    Vitest for `apps/user-client`. Both clean.
  - New deps: `dexie@^4` and `uuidv7@^1.0.2` in user-client.
  - Two minor follow-ups noted for later (not blocking): (a) add input
    validation to `hexToRgb` in `client-data-db.ts` before a Phase-2+
    palette editor wires it up to user input; (b) consider extracting
    the duplicated `asMockFetch` helper if a third llm-unified test
    file needs it.

## Done (continued from Phase 1)

- **Phase 2 — Settings + Circle + Persona Editor + Entrance Hall
  (2026-05-23 evening)**. Squashed into one Phase-2 commit. What landed:
  - `apps/user-client/src/boot/client-data-db.ts` — Dexie v2 migration
    with `.upgrade()` backfilling `Settings.userFont = 'serif'` and
    `PersonaRow.{tagline:'', temperature:0.85, adultPersona:false}`
    on existing rows; seven built-in mindspaces (Crimson, Aurum,
    Verdan, Azuro, Indigaut, Violetta, Rosari) using Lyra's finalised
    hex values; Verdan/Azuro accent hex refreshed from Phase-1
    provisional values.
  - `apps/user-client/src/state/{mindspace-resolver,mindspace.store}.ts`
    — pure resolver + Zustand store driving the active palette.
  - `apps/user-client/src/components/{MindspaceLayer,MindspaceTexture,
    MindspacePicker,PersonaCard,AccordionCard,ProviderSheet,SaveBar}.tsx`
    — the Phase-2 component library. MindspaceTexture ships three
    CSS-only variants (cloudy, aurora, grain) with respect for
    `prefers-reduced-motion`.
  - `apps/user-client/src/data/{queryKeys,settings,personas,providers,
    mindspaces,chats}.ts` — TanStack-Query data layer over Dexie with
    full CUD for personas / providers, plus query-only access for the
    rest.
  - `apps/user-client/src/routes/app/{entrance-hall,circle,
    persona-editor,settings}.tsx` — the four Block-2 surfaces wired
    to data + state, with accordion accordions, FAB navigation,
    save-bar validation, delete-zone with cascade, etc.
  - `apps/user-client/src/App.tsx` — wired `/app` subroutes
    (`/app`, `/app/circle`, `/app/persona/new`, `/app/persona/:id`,
    `/app/settings`); MindspaceLayer mounted at root; `app-shell.tsx`
    placeholder removed.
  - Tests: 63 new Vitest cases across mindspace engine, data layer,
    components, and the four routes; all 129 user-client tests pass.
    Phase-1 packages (crypto, llm-unified) remain untouched and green.

## Briefed, awaiting implementation

- **Phase 3 — Chat** (wireframe-ready): Reading Mode (sacred bottom
  edge, tap-expand, affordance ↔ scroll-to-end), Interaction Mode
  (topbar, 2-row cockpit, dim-overlay, auto-close per Decision 16),
  streaming integration, Pills rendering + ADR "Tool Display
  Position".
- **Phase 4 — History + Polish** (gated on My History wireframe):
  List + search, Setup-Hints (deferred from Phase 2 per Decision 27),
  scroll-to-end micro-animation, affordance glow tuning, network-loss
  / abort / partial-stream-on-tab-close edge cases.

## Open design questions / blockers

- Lyra's wireframe for My History — still in flight; Settings,
  Circle, Persona-Editor have landed (2026-05-23 update of
  `chatsundere-prototype.html`).
- Final 7-Mindspace palette + 2–3 finalised textures — Lyra-led.
- Provider endpoint exact base-URLs and probe paths (nano-gpt, Novita,
  Ollama Cloud) — verified live during Phase 1 implementation.
- "Wider encryption-at-rest" (messages, personas, settings) — Chris
  flagged this is a bigger-group conversation, not a Block 1 decision.
- ADR "Tool Display Position" — drafted during Phase 3 implementation.

## Doing now

Phase 2 finished. Paused for Chris's manual device-test smoke on the
four new surfaces (Entrance Hall, My Settings, My Circle, Persona
Editor) before kicking off Phase 3 (Chat).

---

## Next session

1. **Chris's manual smoke** — fresh PWA install → onboarding "Just
   this device" → Entrance Hall renders with 5 rooms (3 greyed
   stubs). Walk through: My Settings → fill About Me, pick a
   Mindspace colour/texture/font, set Global Unlocker, add at least
   one provider with API key (Ollama-Cloud also asks for proxy URL +
   shared key, both stored on `Settings.corsProxy`). Back to Hall →
   "1 of 3 providers connected" appears on Settings tile. Tap My
   Circle → empty-state "No personas yet"; FAB "+" opens the editor
   in create mode; fill Name + Tagline + Custom Instructions + pick
   a Model → Save → returns to Circle with the persona card visible.
   Tap a persona card → editor opens in edit mode with three chat-
   action buttons up top. Edit a field → Save. Tap a persona →
   Delete → confirm → returns to Circle. Reload PWA → Hall still
   shows everything intact. Verify in DevTools: `chatsundere_client_data`
   now has `verno: 2`, seven mindspaces, one settings row with
   `userFont: 'serif'`, persona row with `tagline / temperature /
   adultPersona` fields.
2. **Phase 3 brainstorm + plan** — walk through the chat surface
   wireframes in `chatsundere-prototype.html` (Reading Mode +
   Interaction Mode + Cockpit). Open the ADR "Tool Display Position"
   discussion.
3. **Phase 3 execution** — subagent-driven, same pattern as Phase 1
   and Phase 2.
